# Child Session for Task ${TASK_ID}

Welcome to your Child development session!

## Task Information
- Task ID: ${TASK_ID}
- Branch: ${TASK_BRANCH}
- Working Directory: ${WORKTREE_PATH}
- Project: ${PROJECT_PREFIX}

## Your Responsibilities as Child:
1. **Task Implementation**
   - Focus on your assigned task ${TASK_ID}
   - Work in isolated worktree environment
   - Implement features according to task requirements

2. **Branch Management**
   - Work on branch: ${TASK_BRANCH}
   - Commit changes regularly
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Write tests for new features
   - Ensure code passes linting

4. **Communication**
   - Report progress to Master via web service
   - Update task status when complete
   - Signal completion for Master detection

## Development Workflow:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# View task status
git status

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Task ${TASK_ID}: Description of changes"

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linting
uv run ruff check src/ --fix
```

## Important Notes:
- You are working in an isolated worktree: ${WORKTREE_PATH}
- Your changes are on branch: ${TASK_BRANCH}
- Master will detect when you complete your task
- DO NOT merge to main - Master handles integration

## Task Completion:
When your task is complete:
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Run tests to verify functionality
3. Update task status (if applicable)
4. Master will detect completion and handle merge

Ready to implement Task ${TASK_ID}!
